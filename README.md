# Learning-Arduino

This repo contains the tasks/projects I worked on when I started learning Arduino.

Night Light
- This was one of the first things in my learning process.
- I learned about analog inputs and used a photoresistor to determine when to turn on/off an LED.

Stop Light
- In this program I learned about delays in loops and how to use them properly
- I used a potentiometer to switch between two modes for the stop light

Parallax High Speed CR Servo
- In this project I learned how to control continuous rotation servo motors
- There are four different programs, going from just writing a value to the servo motor to
  controlling the position and speed with a potentiometer
  
Car
- This was my first project with arduino and it was a way for me to combine what I had learned so far
  as well as learn LCD and apply all of this to inputs and outputs that would be linked with mechanical parts.
  
Shoes
- These controlled an LED strip for a pair of shoes that turned on and off every step and changes colors
